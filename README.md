# high_pass_and_low_pass_filters
Implementation of a high pass and a low pass filters in an image

The major objective of this is to experiment with a low pass and a high pass filters, following four minor objectives:

1) Smooth the noise using an appropriate low-pass filter, without losing important edge information.
2) Enhance the edges of the smoothed image using a high-pass filter.
3) Compare the results obtained with different filter sizes and provide an analysis.
4) Produce final images that highlight visible edges and minimize noise.

It also respond the following questions:

- Which low-pass filter was most effective without overly blurring the image?
- Does the choice of filter size influence the edge enhancement by the high-pass filter?
- Is it possible to apply the filters in reverse order (first high-pass, then low-pass)? Why or why not?
